a = int(input(" Enter the first number : "))

b = int(input(" Enter the second number : "))

add = a + b

sub = a - b

mult = a * b

div = a / b

print(" Addition of given numbers is ", add)

print(" Subtractiom of given numbers is " , sub)

print(" Multiplication of given numbers is ", mult)

print(" division of given numbers is ", div)
